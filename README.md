# InsuranceSoftware
This is a prototype of an insurance buying software that simulates the process of receiving insurance applications, accepting or rejecting them, collecting revenue, 
and paying out insurance claims. 
The program allows the user to manage up to 20 insurance agreements, each containing the client name, yearly fee, risk (yearly chance of accident), 
and insurance amount.

As a newcomer to programming, I kindly request feedback on my code and how well I have applied object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in this project. 
Since I am learning, any constructive feedback, suggestions, or improvements are greatly appreciated.
